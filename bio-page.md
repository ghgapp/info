# Bio
`Pradeep Alva` is a postdoctoral researcher in the Circular Future Cities module at the Future Cities Laboratory (FCL) Global Programme, part of the Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC). He received his PhD in Architecture from the <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/">National University of Singapore (NUS)</a>. He submitted his PhD thesis on the topic of "Urban Digital Twins", under the supervision of <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/staffs/rudi-stouffs-dr/">Prof. Dr. Rudi Stouffs</a> and <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/staff/clayton-miller-dr/">Prof. Dr. Clayton Miller</a>. As part of his research, he developed a 3D web map application called the <a href="https://ghgapp.github.io/">"GHG App"</a>, which serves as a user experience dashboard for decision-makers involved in greenhouse gas <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4BFgtU0hJU">(GHG)</a> emissions mitigation and decarbonisation initiatives in cities.

He was honoured with the Young CAADRIA Award in 2024 and nominated as the Young Leader for his contribution to academic research at the World Cities Summit 2024.

Before this, he was part of the course development team of an NUS-EdX professional certificate programme - <a href="https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/nus-spatial-computational-thinking">"Spatial Computational Thinking"</a>, which teaches the theoretical knowledge and practical skills required for leveraging computation for the manipulation of various types of spatial data. He has previously worked on GIS modelling and software development of Planning Support Systems (PSS) at the Design Automation Lab, headed by Prof Patrick Janssen. Pradeep has performed complex GIS models and designed various geospatial urban planning decision-making frameworks. Using Python in the ArcGIS domain, he developed a set of tools as part of the research that can be used by city planners. He holds a master’s degree in integrated sustainable design from NUS, where he worked on research studio projects based in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. During which he studied existing ecosystems and urban models/networks to inform design decisions holistically that work towards a positive impact on the environment we live in.

Prior to joining NUS, he was a Project Architect in India where he was involved in executing renowned institutional and residential projects. Pradeep holds a bachelor’s degree in Architecture, MSc in Integrated Sustainable Design (NUS) and is registered as an Architect at the Council of Architecture (COA) established by the Government of India. He is a certified Cesium Inc Developer.
